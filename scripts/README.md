# Scripts Directory

This directory contains build scripts, migrations, and utility scripts that are used during development.

## Guidelines

1. One-time migration scripts should be deleted after use
2. Recurring utility scripts should be documented here
3. Consider converting frequently used scripts to npm scripts in package.json
4. All scripts should have clear comments explaining their purpose
